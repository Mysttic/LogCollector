LogCollector is a tool that allows you to aggregate logs from different applications and solutions, collected in one place. All logs are collected in one common database, making it easier to filter and search for the desired data.

The solution also includes the ability to define monitors that will check logs according to the conditions you specify and perform the appropriate action in the event of an occurrence.
